# Netflix SQL Data Analysis Project

This project explores and analyzes the **Netflix Movies and TV Shows** dataset using SQL inside a Jupyter Notebook. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and loaded into a SQLite database using Python. SQL queries were used to answer key questions about content types, genres, ratings, countries, and trends over time. Visualizations were created using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.

## Skills Demonstrated

- SQL querying (SQLite)
- Data analysis with pandas
- Data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks for data science workflows

## Questions Answered with SQL

- How many movies vs TV shows are on Netflix?
- What is the trend of new content added over the years?
- Which countries produce the most Netflix content?
- What are the most common content ratings?
- Who are the top directors with the most titles?
